# Description

Was suprised that there wasn't any major soundbox that allowed you to directly use a web url without having to download it. Well, figure that not impossible to play sound of your navigator in any audio output but that's hard to do reliably.

Features :
- Global system hotkeys
- Save sounds with differents volumes
- Allow to play a sound multiples times at once
- Allow to play sound directly from a link
